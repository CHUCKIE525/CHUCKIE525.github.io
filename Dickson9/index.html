            <h2>- What was Sharecropping?</h2>
            <p>Sharecropping is a system where a weathly landowner would give a wokrer shelter and food in extchange for a large portion of the crops that they farmed. It was used after slavery was "abolished" and often benifited the landowners much more than the poor workers.
            </p>

            <h2>- What was the goal of Sharecropping and what did it achieve?</h2>

            <p>The primary goal of sharecropping was to bring back the plantation workforce for the landowners, and it resulted in a very large population of “freed” slaves being forced to go back into the plantations because they were uneducated, had no money or jobs, and didn’t have a place to live.</p>
        </div>

    <h2>- Why did so many of the "free" slaves join back into an agreement such as sharecropping?</h2>

    <p>There were many reasons that people were indirectly forced back into sharecropping even after they were considered free. The main reasons were lack of shelter, lack of money and jobs, and lack of education.</p>

            <h2 id="money">- Money and Jobs</h2>

            <p>Right after slavery was abolished there were 2 issues: plantation owners had no workers, and previous slaves had nowhere to work. This along with the fact that they had no money, created the idea of sharecropping. It seemed like a perfect solution for both sides, although it really only helped the landowners. Now that sharecropping was a thing, the majority of laborers went back to work on plantations, as it was really the only choice they had. Once they were in the cycle, it was almost impossible to get out, as their debt just grew bigger. Instead of getting a wage, the workers only got food and shelter, which meant that anything else they needed came out of money that they didn't have. They were also negatively effected when they couldn't pay the land owners what they bargained for in percentage of crops, which lead to even more debt. This is what kept them in the sharecropping aragnment, as there was no way to escape. </p>

            <div class="pp">
                <p>After being freed from slavery, the people were left to their own devices. They had no land, no money, and nowhere to stay. Even with organizations such as the "freedmen", a bureau made to "assisted formerly enslaved persons by legalizing marriages, supplying necessities such as food and clothing, promoting education, witnessing labor contracts between the freedmen and plantation owners or other employers, and settling freedmen on abandoned or confiscated land", the majority were stuck without anything. This was another very large motivator to sign sharecropping contracts, as they promised a place to live.</p>

            <h2 id="education">- Lack of Education</h2>

            <p>Probably the largest reason that so many people were indirectly forced into sharecropping agreements was that they were uneducated. Almost all of the African American slaves were never taught anything, so they were illiterate and uneducated. This meant that it was very hard for them to get any other job than hard labor, which is what they had done all of their lives. Due to this, there were almost no other oppurtunities for work after slavery was abolished. Generations of families had worked as slaves their whole lives, and with sharecropping, it was possible again for that to happen. "You see my father, his mother and father both were slaves. And my mother’s father and mother both were slaves. And, you know, was a rule they say that whatever the white man would tell them, they believed him. And if he says, “Well, you didn’t earn but five dollars this year,” they believed him. So see someone was still livin' under the bonds of slavery." (Interview with Minnie Whitney)</p>
